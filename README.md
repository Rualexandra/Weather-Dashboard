# Server-Side API Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard allows travelers to see the weatheroutlook for multiple cities to plan trips accordingly

# How it works:

When you open the application a weather dashboard with form inputs will appear,
Search for a city to be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
Current weather conditions for that city will appear with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
When viewing future weather conditions for that city, a 5-day forecast will be presented that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. You can also click on a city in the search history to again be presented with current and future conditions for that city.
